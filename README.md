# BMS_con

This is the code for a 7key controller made to play BMS using softwares such as beatoraja.
The target is ST's dev board Nucleo F429ZI.

As stated in ST's documentation
> Warning:
USB Microâ€“AB connector (CN13) cannot power the Nucleo-144 board. In order to avoid damaging the STM32, it is mandatory to power the Nucleo-144 before connecting a USB cable on CN13. Otherwise there is a risk of current injection on STM32 IOs.
